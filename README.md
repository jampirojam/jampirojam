Hello, just call me Ojam, IT geek with an educational perspective. Sometimes called as writer, and I think that's true, 'cause I love to write both text and code. Oh, one thing, it's a secret and don't tell anyone, ok! You're cool. Btw, thanks for taking your time to look at my GitHub profile.

Don't forget to connect, ok!
